# German Credit Risk Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting **credit risk** using machine learning. The goal is to classify whether a credit applicant is a **good** or **bad** credit risk based on financial, personal, and employment-related information.

We use the **German Credit (Statlog) dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, a well-known benchmark dataset in finance and machine learning. Beyond prediction accuracy, the project emphasizes **interpretability** and understanding which factors contribute most to credit risk decisions.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Dataset:** German Credit (Statlog)  
- **Samples:** 1,000 credit applications  
- **Features:** 24 (financial, employment, and personal attributes)  
- **Target:**  
  - `1` → Good credit  
  - `2` → Bad credit  

The dataset is slightly imbalanced:
- ~70% good credit  
- ~30% bad credit  

This imbalance is taken into account during evaluation and model validation.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the structure and characteristics of the credit data  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Analyze feature–target relationships  
- Prepare the data properly for machine learning  
- Build interpretable models rather than overly complex ones  

The project prioritizes **clarity and reasoning** over marginal performance gains.
